# YaTTI - Indonesian Open Technology Foundation

YaTTI (Yayasan Teknologi Terbuka Indonesia) is the Indonesian Open Technology Foundation, established in 2014 with a clear mission: to democratise technology and make knowledge freely available to all Indonesians. We believe that sustainable progress comes not from proprietary systems or closed knowledge, but from transparency, collaboration, and shared innovation.

In a society where information has traditionally been closely held and access restricted by hierarchy, YaTTI works to transform Indonesia's digital landscape through open technology. We accomplish this by:

- **Building practical open source tools** that serve real Indonesian needsâ€”from AI-powered legal search engines that navigate our complex regulatory environment, to knowledgebases that preserve and share cultural wisdom
- **Advocating for open data policies** that make government information accessible and actionable
- **Creating educational resources** that empower communities to participate meaningfully in the digital economy
- **Developing transparent governance models** that demonstrate accountability in practice

### Open Technology Advocacy
Through [comprehensive position papers](https://yatti.id/statements/) and practical implementations, we promote:
- Open Source development methodologies
- Open Data initiatives
- Open Standards and Protocols
- Open Science practices
- Creative Commons and Open Commons principles
- Open Patent frameworks
- Transparent Open Governance models

## What We Do

### Localisation Initiatives

YaTTI develops and maintains the **official en_ID locale definition** - the English (Indonesia) locale that enables proper date, time, currency, and cultural formatting for English-language software used in Indonesia. This crucial infrastructure ensures that international software respects Indonesian conventions while operating in English.

### Knowledgebase Systems
We maintain [specialised vector databases and APIs](https://yatti.id/kb/) for querying domain-specific knowledge, including:
- [Applied Anthropology](https://yatti.id/kb/appliedanthropology.php) resources
- [Secular Dharma](https://yatti.id/kb/seculardharma.php) teachings
- Indonesian legal and regulatory information ([peraturan.go.id](https://yatti.id/kb/peraturan.go.id.php))

**API Endpoint**: `https://yatti.id/v1/` (Under development)

### Major Software Projects

#### Core Knowledgebase Infrastructure
- **customkb** - Advanced knowledgebase management system with vector database support, semantic search capabilities, and LLM integration
- **kb-query** - Command-line interface for querying knowledgebases with support for context-aware responses and reference material integration (under development)
- **dejavu2-cli** - Modern terminal-based file browser and manager with advanced search and filtering capabilities

#### System Utilities
- **md2ansi** - Markdown to ANSI converter for beautiful terminal output, supporting tables, syntax highlighting, and custom themes
- **checkpoint** - Intelligent backup and checkpoint system for development workflows
- **syshealth** - Comprehensive system monitoring and health checking suite
- **rtfm** - Smart documentation reader and search tool ("Read The Fine Manual")
