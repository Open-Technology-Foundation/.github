# YaTTI - Indonesian Open Technology Foundation

YaTTI (Yayasan Teknologi Terbuka Indonesia) is the Indonesian Open Technology Foundation, established in 2014 with a clear mission: to democratise technology and make knowledge freely available to all Indonesians. We believe that sustainable progress comes not from proprietary systems or closed knowledge, but from transparency, collaboration, and shared innovation.

In a society where information has traditionally been closely held and access restricted by hierarchy, YaTTI works to transform Indonesia's digital landscape through open technology. We accomplish this by:

- **Building practical open source tools** that serve real Indonesian needsâ€”from AI-powered legal search engines that navigate our complex regulatory environment, to knowledgebases that preserve and share cultural wisdom
- **Advocating for open data policies** that make government information accessible and actionable
- **Creating educational resources** that empower communities to participate meaningfully in the digital economy
- **Developing transparent governance models** that demonstrate accountability in practice

## What We Do

### Knowledgebase Systems
We maintain specialised vector databases and APIs for querying domain-specific knowledge, including:
- Applied Anthropology resources
- Secular Dharma teachings
- Indonesian legal and regulatory information (peraturan.go.id)

**API Endpoint**: `https://yatti.id/v1/`

### Major Software Projects

#### Core Infrastructure
- **customkb** - Advanced knowledgebase management system with vector database support, semantic search capabilities, and LLM integration
- **kb-query** - Command-line interface for querying knowledgebases with support for context-aware responses and reference material integration

#### Development Tools
- **dejavu2-cli** - Modern terminal-based file browser and manager with advanced search and filtering capabilities
- **md2ansi** - Markdown to ANSI converter for beautiful terminal output, supporting tables, syntax highlighting, and custom themes
- **mdir2md** - Directory-to-markdown documentation generator that creates comprehensive project documentation
- **typewriter** - Terminal text animation tool for creating engaging command-line experiences

#### AI and Language Processing
- **transcribe** - High-quality audio transcription using OpenAI's Whisper with intelligent post-processing
- **translate** - Multi-language translation utilities optimised for Indonesian contexts
- **whatlang** - Language detection tool supporting Indonesian and regional languages

#### System Utilities

- **syshealth** - Comprehensive system monitoring and health checking suite
- **rtfm** - Smart documentation reader and search tool ("Read The Fine Manual")

### Localisation Initiatives

YaTTI develops and maintains the **official en_ID locale definition** - the English (Indonesia) locale that enables proper date, time, currency, and cultural formatting for English-language software used in Indonesia. This crucial infrastructure ensures that international software respects Indonesian conventions while operating in English.
